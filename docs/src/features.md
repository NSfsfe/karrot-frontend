# Karrot Features

This is in detail description of all the features in Karrot. For each feature section it should explain the context, and the philosophy, and the details. Perhaps it's a bit like a spec? But right now an attempt by me to understand the features and have them in one place, so I can think more clearly!

See the entries in the menu on the left for more details.
